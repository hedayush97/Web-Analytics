# 1.The team wants to analyze each variable of the data collected through data 
# summarization to get a basic understanding of the dataset and to prepare for 
# further analysis. To understand how the data is distributed in the dataset and 
# the kind of variables present along with their count, what is their maximum and 
# minimum value, etc., a summarization of the data is done.
# 
# Code:

mydata = read.csv('Internet_Dataset.csv')

# Dataset Description:
# The variables in the dataset are defined here for better understanding:
# 
#   
# Attribute	          Description
# Bounces	            It represents the percentage of visitors who enter the site 
#                     and "bounce" (leave the site) rather than continuing to view other pages within the same site.
# Continent	          It shows the continent from which the site has been accessed.
# Source group	      It shows how the visitor has accessed the site.
# Time on page	      It shows how long the user has spent on that particular page of the website.
# Unique pageview    	It represents the number of sessions during which that page was viewed one or more times.
# Visits	            A visit counts all visitors, no matter how many times the same visitor may have been to your site.

summary(mydata)
str(mydata)

# Result:
# From the result of summarized dataset, it is observed that the numerical data 
# includes information related to the maximum, minimum, and mean data. The categorical 
# data like continent includes the data of the number of times the category has 
# been repeated in the dataset. We can see that there is a maximum value of 30 
# bounces for the website. This site was accessed maximum number of times by visitors 
# from North America.

# 2.	As mentioned earlier, a unique page view represents the number of 
# sessions during which that page was viewed one or more times.
# A visit counts all instances, no matter how many times the same visitor 
# may have been to your site. So the team needs to know whether the unique 
# page view value depends on visits. - ANOVA

# Ho : The unique page view value does not depends on visits
# Ha : The unique page view value depends on visits


aov1 <- aov(Uniquepageviews ~ as.factor(Visits), data=mydata)
summary(aov1)

#Result: Since, the value of p value is less than alpha value hence we reject the null hypothesis. 
#This shows that unique page views depends on visits.

# 3.	Find out the probable factors from the dataset which could affect the exits.
re1 <- glm(Exits ~ Bounces + Continent + Uniquepageviews +Visits +Continent, data = mydata)
summary(re1)

# 4.	Every site wants to increase the time on page for a visitor. 
# This increases the chances of the visitor understanding the site content 
# better and hence there are more chances of a transaction taking place. 
# Find the variables which possibly have an effect on the time on page.
# To understand and analyze the factors that are related to the time on 
# page of the site, we need to use ANOVA. 

aov3 <- aov(Timeinpage ~ Bounces + Exits + Uniquepageviews + Visits , data= mydata)
summary(av3)
#Result: Time inpage is dependent on the Exit variable as pvalue of Exit is less than than alpha value.

# 5.	A high bounce rate is a cause of alarm for websites that depend 
# on visitor engagement. Help the team in determining the factors that 
# are impacting on the bounce.

mydata$Bounces <- mydata$Bounces * 0.01
